        <h2>🌮 Skills and Expertise</h2>
      
        <h3>🟢 Node.js</h3>
        <p>
          I have extensive experience with Node.js, utilizing its non-blocking, event-driven architecture to build efficient and scalable server-side applications. I'm proficient in key concepts such as asynchronous programming, Express.js for building robust APIs, and integrating various databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL. My projects often involve using middleware, routing, and handling real-time data with Socket.IO.
        </p>
      
        <h3>⚛️ React</h3>
        <p>
          React is my go-to library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. I'm well-versed in its core concepts, including component-based architecture, state management using hooks and Redux, and the virtual DOM. I enjoy creating modular and reusable components, implementing complex forms, and optimizing performance with techniques like code splitting and lazy loading.
        </p>
      
        <h3>💻 C and C++</h3>
        <p>
          My programming journey began with C and C++, where I developed a strong foundation in procedural and object-oriented programming. I have a deep understanding of memory management, pointers, and data structures. My projects in C/C++ include implementing algorithms, developing small-scale applications, and working with embedded systems.
        </p>
      
        <h3>📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</h3>
        <p>
          Data Structures and Algorithms are at the core of my problem-solving approach. I have a solid grasp of various data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. I'm proficient in algorithmic techniques such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and graph traversal. Regular practice of competitive programming has honed my skills in writing efficient and optimized code.
        </p>
      
        <h3>☕ Java</h3>
        <p>
          Java is another language in my toolkit, particularly for backend development and Android applications. I'm familiar with Java's object-oriented principles, multithreading, exception handling, and the Java Collections Framework. I've used frameworks like Spring Boot for building RESTful services and Hibernate for ORM. Additionally, I've worked on Android projects involving UI design, database integration, and network communication.
        </p>
